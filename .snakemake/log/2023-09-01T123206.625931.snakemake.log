Error in rule run_mrbayes:
    jobid: 0
    input: aligned_protein_sequences.fasta
    output: mrbayes_output.nex
    shell:
        mb aligned_protein_sequences.fasta > mrbayes_output.nex
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job run_mrbayes since they might be corrupted:
mrbayes_output.nex
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
