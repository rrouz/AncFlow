Error in rule autophy:

    input: RAxML_bestTree.nwk
    shell:
        autophy -t RAxML_bestTree.nwk
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
