MissingOutputException in rule rename_tree_file in file /Users/ryinrouzbehani/Documents/SDSU/Research/WF1/Snakefile, line 94:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
output/autophy_tree.newick
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
