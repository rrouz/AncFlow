NameError: The name 'tree_data' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        python - <<EOF
        import sys

        input_tree_file = sys.argv[1]
