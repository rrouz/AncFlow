Error in rule convert_to_phy_format:
    jobid: 1
    input: protein_sequences.fasta

    shell:
        convert_to_phy_format.py protein_sequences.fasta > protein.phy
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job convert_to_phy_format since they might be corrupted:
protein.phy
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
