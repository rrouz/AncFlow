ImproperOutputException in rule seq_prep in file /Users/ryinrouzbehani/Documents/SDSU/Research/WF1/Snakefile, line 12:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule seq_prep:
    output: your_run_name/logs/seq_prep_complete.txt
    affected files:

Removing output files of failed job seq_prep since they might be corrupted:
your_run_name/logs/seq_prep_complete.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
